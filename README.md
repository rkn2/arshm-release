Experimental mobile app demoing cultural heritage documentation tools in augmented reality. Supports capturing and annotating photos in 3D space. Proof-of-concept features in the app include image anchoring and surface drawing tools. Implemented in Unity using the [ARInterface library](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/experimental-ARInterface) for cross-platform AR support.

Created in Spring 2018 as part of a Computer Science Independent Work project at Princeton University, advised by Professor Branko Glisic and Rebecca Napolitano.

More information about the project is described in the paper: [Mobile AR Software for Cultural Heritage Documentation](written_final_report.pdf).
